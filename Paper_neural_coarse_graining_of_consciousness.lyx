\begin_layout Abstract
Neural systems process information through different levels of organisation in a hierarchical manner. Information at lower levels is finer-grained and can be coarse-grained for higher level computation. However, one is aware of information processed only at specific levels. Theorists have addressed this issue. For example, the intermediate level theory of consciousness suggests that the intermediate level seems to be privileged with respect to consciousness. It is true that we do not experience information processed by individual neurons which is always highly noisy. Besides, we have no conscious experience from interpersonal activities albeit massive interactions among individuals. Instead, neurophysiological evidence has been showing that conscious experience tends to covary with information encoded in coarse-grained neural states such as neural population codes. We argue that the neural states within the scope of the information closure determine the contents of consciousness and brain processes outside apart from the representations of that level remain unconscious. This argument suggests a distinction between conscious and unconscious processing and provides a generic computational framework. Finally, using the deep learning network, we can measure information closure in deep hidden layers. Our preliminary results show that information closure representation emerged after learning. We further decoded the information from the representation and compared it with human conscious perception.

 Given the overwhelming quantity of information available from the environment, how do young learners know what to learn about and what to ignore? We found that 11-month-old infants (N = 110) used violations of prior expectations as special opportunities for learning. The infants were shown events that violated expectations about object behavior or events that were nearly identical but did not violate expectations. The sight of an object that violated expectations enhanced learning and promoted information-seeking behaviors; specifically, infants learned more effectively about objects that committed violations, explored those objects more, and engaged in hypothesis-testing behaviors that reflected the particular kind of violation seen. Thus, early in life, expectancy violations offer a wedge into the problem of what to learn.

 Our theoretical interest concerns the type of system that is a unity for and by itself and not only for an external observer distinguishing some entity from the rest of the world. This requires a system that can be described as a whole without reference to its environment. In systems theory, this property is usually referred to as closure.

Non-trivial information closure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information closure could be trivial. That is, when a system is fully independent from the environment, no information can flow into the system from the environment and also leak to the environment from the system. Equa. xxxx shows the mathematical description of trivial information closure. When mutual information between the environment and system future state close to 0, and the system transition is independent from the environment, the system can reach informational closure. However, such systems do not have any functional meaning and evolutional advantages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it's important to ensure the informational closure that the system reach is non-trivial.

 can achieve informational closure either by gaining information about the environment or by increased autonomy, i.e. by becoming unpredictable or uncontrollable from the (13) environment.

 It seems natural to phrase the problem of prediction in relation to the visual stimulus, as in Fig. 3, but the brain has no direct access to visual stimuli except that provided by the retina. Could the brain learn, in an unsupervised fashion, to predict the future of retinal outputs? More precisely, if we observe that a population of retinal ganglion cells generates the word w t at time t, what can we say about the word that will be generated at time t + Î t in the future? The answer to this question is contained in the conditional distribution of one word on the other, P Ã° w t +Î t j w t Ã

 The intermediate level theory originally proposed by Ray Jackendoff and further defended and specified by Jesse Prinz proposes that within the hierarchy of representations that are used to describe the cognitive system, conscious experience occurs only for specific levels of representation. The theory is rooted in Jackendoff âs analysis of different cognitive systems such as vision, language, and music and the subsequent observation that consciousness does not arise anywhere within these systems. According to Jackendoff, consciousness is not associated with low-level, nor with high-level representations, but rather with those implying intermediate levels of processing. For instance, in the domain of object recognition, it is assumed that the visual system comprises a low level with local computations of visual features, an intermediate level reflecting binding and object recognition, and a higher level computing viewpoint invariance and representing abstract categories. According to Jackendoff and Prinz, conscious experience is not comprised of a disunified picture of visual features, nor is it represented by viewinvariant categories. Rather it is composed of bound and specific instances of objects that are assumed to be computed at the intermediate level of representation. In an analogous manner, speech perception can be decomposed into three levels: an acoustic representation of speech sounds at the lower level, a high level involving abstract lexical and syntactic categories, and in between a word recognition level relying on phonological representations. This theory explains why the conscious experience associated with speech perception mostly involves phonological representations, rather than other levels of representations. In Jackendoff and Prinzâ theory,the privileged role of the intermediate level of processing is based on the need for real-time computational efficiency. Indeed, this level of representation is assumed to be the most relevant one regarding ecological and functional needs. Another important aspect of this theory concerns the central role of attention during conscious experience. Here, attention is defined as a selection process that acts as a gate to working memory mechanisms. It performs the function of selecting the relevant information that is amplified afterward and then becomes conscious. Indeed, Prinz acknowledges that activation of an intermediatelevel representation on its own cannot be a sufficient condition for consciousness, given that those representations can be activated during subliminal perception. However, this theory makes the crucial postulate that the amplification of intermediatelevel representations by attention is a necessary and sufficient condition for consciousness. In sum, for each domain of processing, the content of consciousness at a particular moment is supported by a representational structure of intermediate level for that domain, which is selected to enter short-term memory, and enriched by attentional processing.

 In 1987, Ray Jackendoff published Consciousness and the Computational Mind. In it, he posed an important Where question: Where, in the fl ow of information, does consciousness arise? Most cognitive scientists agree that the mind is, in some sense, a computer. It is a device that processes information by transforming representations in accordance with rules. Computational devices decompose into various interconnected subsystems, each of which performs some aspect of a complex task. Given such a decompositional analysis, we can ask: in which subsystems does consciousness arise? If we depict the mind as a vast fl ow chart, and highlight the boxes whose rules and representations are conscious, which boxes should we mark? Jackendoff âs answer is simple and elegant. He noticed that many of our mental capacities, including our senses and our language systems, are organized hierarchically. In each of these hierarchies, it makes sense to talk about low- , intermediate- , and high- level processing systems. We break down tasks into stages. Appealing to prevailing models of these stages, Jackendoff observed that the intermediate level seems to be privileged with respect to consciousness. Consciousness seems to arise in intermediate- level processing systems and not elsewhere.

 Under the computational interpretation, the âwhyâ question means: In what sense are intermediate level representations computationally important or distinctive? Th is is a tractable question, and it may lead to insights into the function of consciousness. Representations at the intermediate level are ideally suited for real- time deliberative behavioral responses. Low- level representations fail to bind features into coherent wholes. If we are going to interact with our environment, the low level is not a good guide. Th e high level is a good deal better for action, but also suboptimal. Th e high level tells us the category of the stimuli we perceive, but from an allocentric point of view. It abstracts away from stimulus features that are crucial for action. If we encounter a predator, the high- level visual representation does not tell us if it is facing toward us or away from us. Without that knowledge, we cannot decide what course of action to take. So, I propose that the intermediate level plays a distinctive role in information processing. It delivers representations that are coherent but viewpoint specifi c. Th ese representations are useful for determining what to do here and now.arg1

 I conclude that the intermediate level plays a distinctive and important computational role. Some researchers fi nd this puzzling. In wondering why the intermediate level is privileged, they note the arbitrariness of the fact that perceptual hierarchies have three levels. Could they not have two? Or a hundred? Do the 50 or so areas that contribute to visual processing really divide neatly into three levels? I think these puzzles depend on a particular understanding of what the word âintermediateâ amounts to. One might get caught up in the fact that the intermediate level is the second stage in a sequence. Call this the âserial understanding of the intermediate level.â Alternatively, one might think of the intermediate level semantically. On this reading, the intermediate level is one that is not abstract and categorical, but not piecemeal or disunifi ed. Th ese notions are all in need of some refi nement, but, as a fi rst approximation, the idea is that intermediate- level representations are neither too specifi c nor too general.

 ddThe ï¬rst-order view maintains that conscious awareness is determined by early sensory activity alone, independently of higher-order representations. Thus the crucial difference between the ï¬rst-order and higher-order views is that the latter but not the former predict that conscious awareness is determined at least in part by prefrontal and parietal activity.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Therefore, in the group of ï¬rst-order theorists we include here not only those commonly labeled as such in the philosophical literature [11] but also theorists, such as Ned Block [12,13], who hold that the phenomenal qualities of awareness depend on the biological substrate rather than merely the content of the ï¬rst-order representations, as well as scientists who hold that visual awareness depends on activity in content-speciï¬c regions of the extrastriate cortex [24,25] or on feedback from these regions to the primary visual cortex [26].
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Most ï¬rst-order theories explain the difference between awareness and unawareness by positing that the latter is associated with weak information [29] or with representations in alternative (e.g. subcortical) sensory pathways. Thus this view suggests that conscious and unconscious processing will have different functional consequences. Whereas some ï¬rst-order theorists hold that some higher cognitive functions can be performed without conscious awareness [30â32], most ï¬rst-order theorists take a difference in perceptual task performance (e.g. âhitsâ vs âmissesâ in a detection task) as evidence for a difference in conscious awareness [12,13,25,26,33]. In other words, they typically associate task performance with awareness.

Grounded on the distinction between conscious and unconscious processes, Bernard Baarsâ global workspace theory is one of the most influential cognitive theories of consciousness. This theory relies on the metaphor of a theater. In this theater, unconscious specialized processors (equivalent to modules) are assumed to be the actors and the audience. While the audience represents the set of passive processors, actors represents active processors playing on the stage of the theater (i.e., the workspace). These actors are engaged in a competition for being seen by the audience: by broadcasting their information they actually compete for more broadcasting. Active processors with the highest coherent activity can form local coalitions that strengthen them in this competition process. The strongest coalition in this competition dominates the workspace, in a winner-take-all fashion, and corresponds to the content of consciousness. The workspace is equated by Baars to working-memory, in which only the most active content becomes conscious. Additionally, the dominant coalition benefits from global broadcasting, which allows it to recruit new processors from the audience in order to form a global coalition. Here, consciousness allows for the integration of computational resources in a large-scale coordination and for the exchange of information among processors that would otherwise remain separated. In this theory, each processor can operate in the conscious mode if it benefits from global broadcasting through the workspace, or it can operate in the unconscious mode when disconnected from the workspace. An important feature of the global workspace theory is the presence of contexts as stable coalitions shaping access to the workspace. Contexts are constituted of unconscious processors reflecting, in a hierarchical manner, our expectations, our beliefs, our goals, and ultimately our self. In particular, attention is implemented as a goal context in this theory. It is described as a mechanism that controls access to the workspace, acting as a filter and biasing the competition process toward a particular set of actors. At any given moment, the dominant coalition is under the spotlight of attention, and its informational content becomes the content of conscious experience. A crucial aspect of Baarsâ theory is that it avoids the problem of the homunculus by reducing it to an audience of multiple unconscious processors. Here, there is no need for a hypothetical single conscious observer in the system, and thus there is no issue of infinite regression with a homunculus inside another homunculus. Instead, consciousness is considered to reflect the global broadcasting of information to an audience of unconscious processors. As the audience is unconscious, unsupervised, and receptive rather than attending to the information, it does not constitute an internal homunculus.

 According to this view, humans not only have first-order non-conceptual and/or analog perceptions of states of their environments and bodies, they also have second-order non-conceptual and/or analog perceptions of their first-order states of perception. And the most popular version of higher-order perception theory holds, in addition, that humans (and perhaps other animals) not only have sense-organs that scan the environment/body to produce fine-grained representations that can then serve to ground thoughts and action-planning, but they also have inner senses, charged with scanning the outputs of the first-order senses (i.e. perceptual experiences) to produce equally fine-grained, but higher-order, representations of those outputs (i.e. to produce higher-order experiences). A version of this view was first proposed by the British Empiricist philosopher John Locke (1690). In our own time it has been defended especially by Armstrong (1968, 1984) and by Lycan (1996).

 neutral about whether conscious awareness adds signiï¬cant utility or immediate impact on behavior and task performance [1,27]. This is because the view assumes that task performance in most perceptual and cognitive tasks depends mainly on ï¬rst-order rather than higher-order representations. Because conscious awareness can differ even if all ï¬rst-order representations remain completely unchanged, such awareness itself might serve little function [1,27].
