This noise has long been implicated in limiting the reliability (repeatability) of neuronal responses to repeated presentations of identical stimuli. More recently, it has been shown to increase the range of spiking behaviors exhibited in some neural populations. Channel numbers are tied to metabolic efficiency and the stability of resting potential, and channel noise might be exploited by future cochlear implants in order to improve the temporal representation of sound.

@article{Goldwyn2011,
	abstract = {One of the most celebrated successes in computational biology is the Hodgkin-Huxley framework for modeling electrically active cells. This framework, expressed through a set of differential equations, synthesizes the impact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage -- and the highly nonlinear impact of that voltage back on the currents themselves -- into the rapid push and pull of the action potential. Latter studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics are orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes regulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations familiar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing conductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict fluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action potentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex (and higher-dimensional) description than the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel fluctuations with noise terms added to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Many of these approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when compared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are both accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and why, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations. As such, we hope that this review will speed emerging studies of how channel noise modulates electrophysiological dynamics and function. We supply user-friendly Matlab simulation code of these stochastic versions of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations on the ModelDB website (accession number 138950) and http://www.amath.washington.edu/{\~{}}etsb/tutorials.html.},

	abstract = {We quantify the relationship between the dynamics of a time-discrete dynamical system, the tent map T and its iterations T(m), and the induced dynamics at a symbolical level in information theoretical terms. The symbol dynamics, given by a binary string s of length m, is obtained by choosing a partition point [Formula: see text] and lumping together the points [Formula: see text] s.t. T(i)(x) concurs with the i - 1th digit of s-i.e., we apply a so called threshold crossing technique. Interpreting the original dynamics and the symbolic one as different levels, this allows us to quantitatively evaluate and compare various closure measures that have been proposed for identifying emergent macro-levels of a dynamical system. In particular, we can see how these measures depend on the choice of the partition point \textgreek{a}. As main benefit of this new information theoretical approach, we get all Markov partitions with full support of the time-discrete dynamical system induced by the tent map. Furthermore, we could derive an example of a Markovian symbol dynamics whose underlying partition is not Markovian at all, and even a whole hierarchy of Markovian symbol dynamics.},

	abstract = {Brain function involves the activity of neuronal populations. Much recent effort has been devoted to measuring the activity of neuronal populations in different parts of the brain under various experimental conditions. Population activity patterns contain rich structure, yet many studies have focused on measuring pairwise relationships between members of a larger population-termed noise correlations. Here we review recent progress in understanding how these correlations affect population information, how information should be quantified, and what mechanisms may give rise to correlations. As population coding theory has improved, it has made clear that some forms of correlation are more important for information than others. We argue that this is a critical lesson for those interested in neuronal population responses more generally: Descriptions of population responses should be motivated by and linked to well-specified function. Within this context, we offer suggestions of where current theoretical frameworks fall short. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience Volume 39 is July 08, 2016.

However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing.

Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies.

Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

Can we read the neural code? Although this seemingly simple question has helped us shed light on the neural code, we still do not understand the anatomical and neurophysiological constraints that enable these codes to propagate across synapses and form the basis for computations that we need to interact with our environment. The sensitivity of neuronal activity to the timing of synaptic inputs naturally suggests that synchrony determines the form of the neural code, and, in turn, regulation of synchrony is a critical element in 'writing' the neural code through the artificial control of microcircuits to activate downstream structures. In this way, reading and writing the neural code are inextricably linked.},

Groups of cells in the retina also carry information about the future state of their own activity, and we show that this information can be compressed further and encoded by downstream predictor neurons, which then exhibit interesting feature selectivity.

	abstract = {Given the overwhelming quantity of information available from the environment, how do young learners know what to learn about and what to ignore? We found that 11-month-old infants (N = 110) used violations of prior expectations as special opportunities for learning. The infants were shown events that violated expectations about object behavior or events that were nearly identical but did not violate expectations. The sight of an object that violated expectations enhanced learning and promoted information-seeking behaviors; specifically, infants learned more effectively about objects that committed violations, explored those objects more, and engaged in hypothesis-testing behaviors that reflected the particular kind of violation seen. Thus, early in life, expectancy violations offer a wedge into the problem of what to learn.},

But, what exactly is the nature of their relation? Which forms of integration require consciousness? Here, we examine the recent experimental literature with respect to perceptual and cognitive integration of spatiotemporal, multisensory, semantic, and novel information. We suggest that, whereas some integrative processes can occur without awareness, their scope is limited to smaller integration windows, to simpler associations, or to ones that were previously acquired consciously. This challenges previous claims that consciousness of some content is necessary for its integration; yet it also suggests that consciousness holds an enabling role in establishing integrative mechanisms that can later operate unconsciously, and in allowing wider-range integration, over bigger semantic, spatiotemporal, and sensory integration windows.}, journal={Trends in Cognitive Sciences}, author={Mudrik, Liad and Faivre, Nathan and Koch, Christof}}
